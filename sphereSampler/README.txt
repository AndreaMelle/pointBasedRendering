Matlab code to sample a sphere of unit radius and write .txt files with attributes:

x y z r g b a ux uy uz vx vy vz nx ny nz

||u|| and ||v|| are the lengths of surfel ellipses axis.
In this simple implementation, they are the same (so surfel is a circle)

Sampling code uses the handy functions provided by Anton Semechko in http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37004-uniform-sampling-of-a-sphere
